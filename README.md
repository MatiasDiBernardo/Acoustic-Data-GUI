# Acoustic-Data-GUI
Full app to input, display, and save, different acoustic parameters of a given data. 


## Air transmission noise

This software calculates R, STC, Dn and Dnt and their respective spectral coefficients C and Ctr. The input is the appropriate measurements according to either ISO 140-4 or ISO 16283-1. The GUI displays the result and the user can export the data in a PDF report and in Excel.

## Flanking noise transmission

This software returns the noise transmission coefficient, taking into account the direct sound and all the flanks in two congruent rooms. The input data requires the dimensions of both rooms, the type of connections between the rooms and measurements in situ of the L1 and RT.

## Simple Wall Acoustic Isolation

This software calculates the noise transmission loss of different laminar materials in the given database. The user specifies the thickness of the material and its dimensions and also the user can update the database with their own materials. The application compares the result of different analytical approaches to the problem. The methods used are Cramer, Davy, Sharp and ISO 12354-1.
